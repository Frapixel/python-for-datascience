# Course Syllabus

Python Programming for Data Science provides students with the foundational coding skills they need as data scientists. 

We start our journey with an exhaustive tutorial on how to properly set up your environment, which is used throughout the class. Essentially, this consists of:

- Installing **Python 3.x** (we will be using Python 3.6 installed via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) in this class)
- Installing and setting up [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

Then, we move to discussing the basics of the Python programming language:

- Python object model
- built-in data types
- fuctions
- I/O

Finally, we will dig into a set of the most up-to-date data science Python packages, such as:

- ```numpy```/```scipy``` (for numerical/scientific computing)
- ```pandas``` (for data manipulation)
- ```matplotlib```/```seaborn``` (for data visualization)
- ```scikit-learn``` (for machine learning tasks like regression and classification). 

## Course Goal
Eventually, at the end of this module students are expected to be able to implement all the stages of a typical machine learning pipeline: 
from collecting data to building predictive models for solving either a classification or a regression problem.
