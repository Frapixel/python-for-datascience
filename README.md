# Python Programming for Data Science

## General Info

Welcome to Python Programming for Data Science!

This is a first-year course of the [MSc in Data Science of the University of Padova](https://datascience.math.unipd.it/). Indeed, it is one of the three modules which the course "_Fundamentals of Information Systems_" is made of.<br/>
The goal of this module is to teach the basics of the Python programming language along with a special focus on Data Science. In particular, students will become familiar with Python packages that are widely used by the community of data scientists and machine learning practicioners, such as ```numpy```, ```scipy```, ```pandas```, ```seaborn```, and ```scikit-learn```, just to name a few.<br/>
A full detailed description of the course is available [here](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2018/LM/SC/SC2377/000ZZ/SCP7078720/N0).

This repository contains lecture materials (in the form of Jupyter Notebook and PDF slides) as well as exercises from the 2018-19 examination sessions (with solutions).

## Course Syllabus
Python Programming for Data Science provides students with the foundational coding skills they need as data scientists. 

We start our journey with an exhaustive tutorial on how to properly set up your environment, which is used throughout the class. Essentially, this consists of:

- Installing **Python 3.x** (we will be using Python 3.6 installed via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) in this class)
- Installing and setting up [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

Then, we move to discussing the basics of the Python programming language:

- Python object model
- built-in data types
- fuctions
- I/O

Finally, we will dig into a set of the most up-to-date data science Python packages, such as:

- ```numpy```/```scipy``` (for numerical/scientific computing)
- ```pandas``` (for data manipulation)
- ```matplotlib```/```seaborn``` (for data visualization)
- ```scikit-learn``` (for machine learning tasks like regression and classification). 

## Course Goal
Eventually, at the end of this module students are expected to be able to implement all the stages of a typical machine learning pipeline: 
from collecting data to building predictive models for solving either a regression or a classification problem.
