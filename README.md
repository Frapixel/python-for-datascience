# Python Programming for Data Science

Welcome to Python Programming for Data Science!

This is a first-year course of the [MSc in Data Science of the University of Padova](https://datascience.math.unipd.it/). Indeed, it is one of the three modules which the course "_Fundamentals of Information Systems_" is made of.<br/>
The goal of this module is to teach the basics of the Python programming language along with a special focus on Data Science. In particular, students will become familiar with Python packages that are widely used by the community of data scientists and machine learning practicioners, such as ```numpy```, ```scipy```, ```pandas```, ```seaborn```, and ```scikit-learn```, just to name a few.<br/>
A full detailed description of the course is available [here](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2018/LM/SC/SC2377/000ZZ/SCP7078720/N0).

This repository contains lecture materials (in the form of Jupyter Notebook and PDF slides) as well as exercises from the 2018-19 examination sessions (with solutions).
